A WIP program for randomly generating a password based on preferences made by the user.

This program is made with React with the use of hooks to manage state. This allows the code to be separated into smaller more comprehensible pieces, improving readability. It also makes it more open for change and reusability since each piece can be made to work independently or with different purposes. 

The program lets the user pick between 4 options:

    Include Uppercase Letters
    Include Lowercase Letters
    Include Numbers
    Include Symbols

Furthermore it allows the user to pick the length of the password. 

The password is generated by picking random indexes in a string with the appropriate characters in it.

The program also offers an evaluation of how secure the password is. Since this display is constantly updated based on the user input the calculation is extremely simplified. It is inspired by calculating the total amount of combinations.

    passwordLength**2 * avaiableChar.length

This calculation roughly display the relation between objects and samples and gives a good indication on the security of the password.
